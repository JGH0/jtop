## Overview

jtop is a lightweight, terminal-based system monitoring tool written in Java. It aims to replicate the basic functionality of the `top` command, providing a modular interface for easy system monitoring.

## Features

* Resource-efficient design
* No external build tools required
* Modular and tab-based interface
* Supports Java 21+

## Target Platform

* Linux (primary target)
* Other platforms (e.g. macOS, freeBSD) may be supported in the future, pending compatibility testing and development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 21+ installed on your system
* Linux platform

### Building and Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JGH0/jtop.git
   cd jtop
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java src/Main.java
   ```

### System-wide Installation

To install jtop globally so that it can be run from any terminal:

1. Clone the repository (if not done already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JGH0/jtop.git
   cd jtop
   ```

2. Make the build and install scripts executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh install.sh
   ```

3. Build the project using the provided build script:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

4. Install globally (requires root privileges):

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

5. Run jtop from anywhere:

   ```bash
   jtop
   ```

**Notes:**

* The `build.sh` script compiles all Java source files and creates an executable `jtop.jar`.
* The `install.sh` script copies `jtop.jar` to `/usr/local/lib/jtop` and installs a wrapper script in `/usr/local/bin` for easy execution.

### Usage

jtop provides a simple and intuitive interface for system monitoring. Use the following keys to navigate:

* `j`/`k`: Scroll up/down
* `Enter`: Scroll entire row
* `q` or `Ctrl+C`: Quit

## Contributing (starting 24.10 since this is a graded school project)
